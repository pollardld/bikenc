To highlight the unlimited bicycling opportunities that North Carolina offers, the Division of Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation designated a cross-state system of Bicycling Highways. These routes generally parallel the major highways along which cyclists often wish to travel, but offer a more lightly traveled alternative than the busy, major roads that are familiar to most people

Nine different routes covering 3,000 miles of the best North Carolina has to offer comprise the current system.

Use this site to learn more about each of the routes, plan your bicycling trip, and use it during your trip to stay on course!

On the homepage, you can select each of the state bike routes to learn about the route.

On the Plan Your Trip page, you have the option to turn on multiple layers such as bike shops, historic districts, state parks, and campgrounds. You can also change the background of the map to satellite imagery or terrain. You can select a route to view turn-by-turn directions and an elevation profile.
